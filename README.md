I'm currently enrolled in School of Code bootcamp to become a software developer. The bootcamp offers an intensive, immersive learning experience that's designed to prepare me for a career in software development in a relatively short amount of time. Throughout the program, I'm learning important coding languages and software development best practices and developing my soft-skills while gaining experience working on real-world projects. It's been a challenging but rewarding experience, and I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a developer. I believe that becoming a software developer is a smart career choice given the growing demand for skilled developers. I'm committed to putting in the hard work and dedication needed to succeed in this field, and I'm looking forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.
