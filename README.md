# Hi, I'm Anas 👋

I'm a junior software developer with real-world experience, currently working in a professional development team and continuing to grow my skills one project at a time.

Before this, I completed a software development bootcamp that helped me lay the foundations — but most of my learning has come from showing up daily, making mistakes, and figuring things out on the job.

I'm not in a rush to "arrive." I’m just here to keep improving, build things that work, and enjoy the process.

You won’t find anything flashy here — just an honest journey from someone who’s genuinely trying to get better at this craft.
